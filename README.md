# Old-Minecraft-Projects
These are all projects I created with a group of friends in early 2018;;; I was 15 for reference, consists of cheats and anticheats for minecraft. There is no deobfuscated minecraft source code for legal reasons. This is all open for copying if any of this old code is of value to you. This source code might contain vulgarity in comments, etc. I have done my very best to clean this code for pushing to GitHub. I apologize if this is not clean of vulgarity/
